# CityZEN

This is a project that which has been created for the #DTHack17 Smart Public Life Hackathon.

It aims at providing a bluetooth beacon supported service to integrate citizens more into decision making on urban design and infrastructural issues.

The beacon is supposed to send the user a push message to inform them that they are nearby a point of interest on which a voting process is ongoing. This message redirects the user to a webportal for the voting itself. Votes are then being added to an Ethereum blockchain to make sure votes are anonymized and protected against maninipulation.

Voting as well as displaying the result in this project are just a mock up process for presentation purposes at this very moment.
